# Youtube-Downloader
This Python script uses the Pytube library to download a YouTube video. It starts by importing the YouTube class from Pytube. The script sets the YouTube video URL to be downloaded in the videoUrl variable. Using this URL, a YouTube object is created, which represents the video. The script then selects the highest resolution stream available for this video using the get_highest_resolution() method. This stream is downloaded to the current working directory of the script. Finally, the script prints a message indicating the downloaded video's title, confirming the download process's completion.
